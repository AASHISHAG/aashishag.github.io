### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update on my Week 10 and Week 11 progress. This period was the most exciting period. I spent time training the model. Since, training was a little time consuming, I also utilised this time to prepare for my exams.

Itâ€™s week 8 of my GSoC project with Red Hen Lab. As mentioned in an earlier post, running the system on Case HPC is one of the main goals of this GSoC project. I managed to install Kaldi earlier on Case HPC using a Singularity image. This week, I prepared the data from GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation and started the training process on Case HPC.
