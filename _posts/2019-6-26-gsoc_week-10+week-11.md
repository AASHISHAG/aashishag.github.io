### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update on my Week 10 and Week 11 progress. This period was the most exciting period. I spent time training the model. Since, training was a little time consuming, I also utilised this time to prepare for my exams.

New to update and provide results ......

I will keep you posted about my progress!
