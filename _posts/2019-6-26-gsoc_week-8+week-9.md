### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update on my Week 8 and Week 9 progress. This period was the really challenging. I spent this period working on integrating all the modules to create an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition pipeline and re-solving the issues.

Automatic Speech Recognition pipeline has four significant steps:

1. Pre-Processing
2. Feature Extraction
3. Language Model
4. Acoustic Model

The following is depicted in the image below:

When working on integrating all the above modules

I will keep you posted about my progress!
