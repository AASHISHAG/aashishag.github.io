### Describe my work briefly

I happy to be the part of GSoC - 2019 working for the [Distributed Little Red Hen Labs](http://www.redhenlab.org/). 

I utilized the community bonding period to discuss the deliverables with my mentors Jan Gorisch, Peter Uhrig, Elmar Noeth,  and Sumit Vohra. Also getting myself acquainted with the [Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) of Google Summer of Code, the [GSoC timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline), the  [Redhen Student Guideline](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/home/what-kind-of-red-hen-are-you/red-hen-developers), and the  [Redhen Coding style guide](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/home/tutorials-and-educational-resources/red-hen-coding-standards).

Red Hen requires the code to be deployed in HPC servers. Below are some guidelines to access HPC server (courtesy of) [Andrea Pagotto](https://anjapago.github.io/AnalyzeAccountability/).

### Login Steps
### Login to Case Western Reserve University

1. Submit User information to RedHen.
2. RedHen will create an account at Case Western Reserve University (firstname.lastname@case.edu). 
3. On receiving the confirmation, you can Login at http://webmail.case.edu

### Connecting to CWRU Network

1. The Links provided in the previous Email can be used to set up the CWRU Network Login which will be a randomly assigned Username in the format abc123. This username can be used to connect to the VPN.

### Connecting to VPN

To log into the VPN, download the Cisco AnyConnect.

``` bash
Network: vpn.case.edu
```

Further, Login with the Username and Password to CWRU network.  The APP will ask for the second Password, which can we set using DUO application from play store. 

### ssh to HPC

In the terminal type:

``` bash
ssh caseID@rider.case.edu
```

where caseID is the abc123 CWRU login. More guidelines can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/). Once in the HPC, the home directory will be /home/abc123, and the path where you will have room to store data will be  /mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/home/abc123. Next, follow steps to set up ssh keys, as will be explained in an email from RedHen.

### Using Singularity
In order to use Singularity, it must exist in the path. You can test Singularity by pulling from RedHenâ€™s singularity hub, and running the container:

``` bash
module pull singularity
singularity pull --name deepspeech-temp.img shub://RedHenLab/singularity_containers:deepspeech2
```
