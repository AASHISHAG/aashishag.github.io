### Describe my work briefly

I happy to be the part of GSoC - 2019 working for the [Distributed Little Red Hen Labs](http://www.redhenlab.org/). 


Main On-boarding Steps
Login for case western reserve university

First, submit information to RedHen required to create an account, and then you will receive an email from case with information about how to log in and create an email address. The email address provided should be firstname.lastname@case.edu. This can be used to log in to email at http://webmail.case.edu.

Login for CWRU network

Using links provided in the previous email, you can also set up the CWRU network login which will be a randomly assigned username in the format abc123. This username can be used to get into the vpn, and also to sign in here: login.case.edu

Logging in to vpn

To log into the VPN, cisco AnyConnect can be used. The network to log into is vpn.case.edu. Once this is entered, you will need your CWRU network login, and the password you set for it. This log in will also show a field to fill in called second password. This second password comes from Duo. Duo can be set up for Case following these instructions. The main idea is download the app Duo, and connect it with the Case account. The second password to enter will be the numerical code shown in the app.

Ssh into the HPC

In the terminal, ssh @rider.case.edu, where caseID is the abc123 CWRU login. More guidelines can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/). Once in the HPC, the home directory will be /home/abc123, and the path where you will have room to store data will be /mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/home/abc123. Next, follow steps to set up ssh keys, as will be explained in an email from RedHen.

Using Singularity
In order to use Singularity, it must exist in the path. You can test Singularity by pulling from RedHenâ€™s singularity hub, and running the container:
