### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update on my Week 6 and Week 7 progress. I am progressing well with the project as per the proposal. I spent this period working on Acoustic Modelling.

### Acoustic models

Acoustic models are the statistical representations of a phonemeâ€™s acoustic information.

The acoustic models are created by training the models on acoustic features from labeled data, i.e. the transcribed speech corpus. Kaldi provides tremendous flexibility and power in training own acoustic models.

The Acoustic modelling in Kaldi is mono+tri+DNN. (Need to update)

I will keep you posted about my progress!
