### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update on my Week 6 and Week 7 progress. I am progressing well with the project as per the proposal. I spent this period working on Acoustic Modelling.

The Acoustic modelling in Kaldi is mono+tri+DNN. (Need to update)

I will keep you posted about my progress!
