### Describe my work briefly

I am really excited to start my 12 weeks journey with [Distributed Little Red Hen Labs] (http://www.redhenlab.org/). 

Today, I complete my Week-1. The essential tasks during this week was to engage myself deeper in Kaldi [http://kaldi-asr.org]. Kaldi is a toolkit for Speech Recognition written in C++ and licensed under the Apache License v2.0. The documentation is not straight-forward  but I tried to summarize according to my understanding. An Automatic Speech Recognition pipeline has four major steps:

1. Pre-Processing
2. Feature Extraction
3. Acoustic Model
4. Language Model

The following is depicted in the image below:

The essential part of the project is collecting the requisite German Speech dataset, which is
limited. I have gathered a few sources as mentioned in the above sub goals.

If needed we need to make a call if we need to take licensing route or approach organizations
to gather a bigger corpus.

I am happy to update you on my Week-1 progress. I am incredibly thankful to all my mentors for allowing me to start early for the project, so I can later take a break for a few days during my exams.

With some initial hiccups, I began my first week. I started reading the documentation on Kaldi and worked on gathering and pre-processing the open-source speech data according to the format the toolkit accepts. Initially, I am experimenting with just one set of data and want to have an end-to-end pipeline working. Later I will keep on adding more datasets to improve and evaluate the model performance. 

I will keep you posted about my progress.
