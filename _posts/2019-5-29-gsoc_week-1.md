### Describe my work briefly

I am happy to update you on my Week-1 progress. I am incredibly thankful to all my mentors for allowing me to start early for the project, so I can later take a break for a few days during my exams.

With some initial hiccups, I began my first week. I started reading the documentation on Kaldi and worked on gathering and pre-processing the open-source speech data according to the format the toolkit accepts. Initially, I am experimenting with just one set of data and want to have an end-to-end pipeline working. Later I will keep on adding more datasets to improve and evaluate the model performance. 

I will keep you posted about my progress.
